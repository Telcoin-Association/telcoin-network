//! The logic for building worker blocks.
//!
//! Transactions are pulled from the worker's pending pool and added to the block without being
//! executed. Block size is measured in bytes and a transaction's max gas limit. The block is sealed
//! when the pending pool devoid of transactions or the max block size is reached (wei or bytes).
//!
//! The mined transactions are returned with the built block so the worker can update the pool.
