//! These should be used to
//! allow for one place to examine and change. Note the normal and "key" versions, the key versions
//! have the added requirement that the produced bytes will binary sort correctly when used
//! as a DB key.  They do not need be used for anything else, bincode with the with_fixint_encoding
//! option provides this. However bincode can not handle some of our structures so we use bcs for
//! non keys.  BCS encoding however does not meet the sorting requirements for DB keys so we have
//! both encodings.  This can be experimented with by changing these functions.
