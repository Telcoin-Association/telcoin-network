# TN Network

The initial peer-to-peer network library was [anemo](https://github.com/mystenlabs/anemo.git).

This crate is for all protocol network interfaces that rely on anemo.
Eventually, anemo will be replaced with libp2p.

All additional features for p2p networking are in the "tn-network-libp2p" crate.
