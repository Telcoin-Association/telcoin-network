# TEL Precompile — Native ERC-20 at `0x7e1`

This directory implements a **native ERC-20 precompile** for the Telcoin (TEL) token. Unlike a standard Solidity contract, the precompile operates directly on native account balances — `balanceOf(addr)` returns the same value as `addr.balance`. This makes TEL simultaneously the chain's gas token and its primary ERC-20.

The precompile is registered as a `DynPrecompile` inside reth's `PrecompilesMap` at address `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000007e1`. Any `CALL` or `STATICCALL` targeting this address is intercepted by the dispatcher in `mod.rs` and routed to the appropriate handler based on the 4-byte function selector.

## Storage layout

All precompile-managed state lives under the precompile address (`0x7e1`) using Solidity-compatible mapping layouts:

| Base slot | Type                                              | Description                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0         | `mapping(address => uint256)`                     | Pending mint amounts                                             |
| 1         | `mapping(address => uint256)`                     | Unlock timestamps (block.timestamp after which `claim` succeeds) |
| 2         | `mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256))` | ERC-20 allowances                                                |
| 3         | `mapping(address => bool)`                        | Mint roles (`faucet` feature only)                               |
| 4         | `mapping(address => uint256)`                     | EIP-2612 permit nonces                                           |
| 100       | `uint256` (plain slot)                            | Total circulating supply                                         |

Slot derivation follows standard Solidity rules — e.g., `allowance[owner][spender]` is at `keccak256(abi.encode(spender, keccak256(abi.encode(owner, 2))))`. See `helpers.rs` for the implementations.

**Important:** Token balances are **not** in precompile storage. They are native account balances (`account.balance`), which is what makes `balanceOf` equivalent to checking the account's ether balance.

## Token lifecycle

### mainnet (`!faucet`)

```
mint(amount)  →  pending_amount[governance] = amount
                 unlock_ts[governance] = block.timestamp + 7 days

claim(recipient)  →  [if block.timestamp >= unlock_ts]
                     recipient.balance += amount
                     totalSupply += amount
                     clear pending slots

burn(amount)  →  precompile.balance -= amount  (sent to address(0))
                 totalSupply -= amount
```

- **`mint`**: Governance-only. Creates a pending mint with a 7-day timelock. A second `mint` overwrites the previous pending amount (can be used to cancel by minting 0).
- **`claim`**: Permissioned. Only governance safe can claim mint.
- **`burn`**: Governance-only. Destroys tokens held by the precompile's own account.

### Testnet (`faucet` feature)

```
mint(recipient, amount)  →  recipient.balance += amount
                            totalSupply += amount
```

No pending state, no timelock. Mint roles can be granted/revoked by governance.

## Access control

| Function                                        | Who can call                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `mint` (mainnet)                                | Governance only                                    |
| `mint` (faucet)                                 | Governance + dynamically granted mint-role holders |
| `claim`                                         | Anyone (after timelock)                            |
| `burn`                                          | Governance only                                    |
| `grantMintRole` / `revokeMintRole`              | Governance only (faucet feature)                   |
| `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, `permit` | Any account                                        |
| All view functions                              | Any account                                        |

Governance is identified by `GOVERNANCE_SAFE_ADDRESS` from `tn-config`.

## Security considerations

### Timelock bypass (`faucet` feature)

The `faucet` feature **removes the 7-day timelock** on minting. A mainnet binary must never be compiled with this feature enabled. The feature is set at compile time — there is no runtime toggle.

### ERC-20 approve race condition

`approve` overwrites the existing allowance without checking the current value. This is the standard ERC-20 behavior and is subject to the well-known front-running race. Users should set allowance to 0 before setting a new non-zero value, or use `permit` for atomic approval.

### Signature malleability (EIP-2612)

`permit` rejects signatures where `s > SECP256K1N_HALF` to prevent signature malleability. The `v` value must be exactly 27 or 28.

### Double-claim prevention

After `claim` succeeds, both the amount and timestamp storage slots are zeroed, preventing re-entry into the same pending mint.

### Native balance equivalence

Since `balanceOf` reads native account balances, any direct ETH-style transfer (e.g., `CALL` with value) changes the TEL balance without going through the precompile. The precompile's `Transfer` event is only emitted for calls routed through `transfer`/`transferFrom`/`claim`. Off-chain indexers must account for both native transfers and precompile events.

### Total supply accounting

`totalSupply` is only updated by `claim` (increment) and `burn` (decrement). It does **not** account for native balance changes outside the precompile (e.g., gas fees, coinbase rewards). The genesis value must be set correctly at chain initialization.

## Gas costs

Each handler charges a fixed gas amount upfront. The tables below compare each constant against the worst-case solidity-equivalent cost.

These costs do **not** include the base transaction cost (21,000) or calldata costs; those are charged by the EVM before the precompile runs.

| **Total**               |                       | **13,093** |

**Status: OK** — 2.29× headroom. Role-check SLOAD included (non-governance caller worst case).

### `grantMintRole` (faucet) — 22,000 gas

| Operation        | Access          | Gas        |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| SSTORE role slot | cold, 0→nonzero | 22,100     |
| **Total**        |                 | **22,100** |

**Status: Undercharged** — 1.00× headroom. Exceeds gas constant by 100 in worst case (new grant). Re-grants (nonzero→nonzero) cost only 5,000.

### `revokeMintRole` (faucet) — 22,000 gas

| Operation        | Access          | Gas       |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| SSTORE role slot | cold, nonzero→0 | 5,000     |
| **Total**        |                 | **5,000** |

**Status: OK** — 4.40× headroom. The nonzero→0 SSTORE produces a 4,800 refund at transaction end.

### Status key

- **Undercharged** (headroom < 1.0×): The gas constant is lower than the worst-case EVM cost. The precompile charges less gas than an equivalent Solidity contract would consume. The operation is subsidized relative to EVM costs.
- **Tight** (headroom 1.0×–1.2×): The gas constant barely covers the worst-case EVM cost. No margin for implementation overhead or future gas schedule changes.
- **OK** (headroom > 1.2×): Sufficient margin above worst-case EVM cost.

## Testing

Test infrastructure lives in `test_utils.rs` and is the single source of truth for both unit tests (in each module's `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) and integration tests (in `crates/tn-reth/tests/it/`).

```bash
# Unit tests (mainnet mint)
cargo test -p tn-reth --lib tel_precompile

# Unit tests (faucet mint)
cargo test -p tn-reth --lib tel_precompile --features faucet

# Integration tests
cargo test -p tn-reth --features test-utils --test it -- tel_precompile

# Integration tests with faucet
cargo test -p tn-reth --features "test-utils,faucet" --test it -- tel_precompile
```
