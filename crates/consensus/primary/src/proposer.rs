//! The Proposer is responsible for proposing the primary's next header when certain conditions are
//! met.
//!
//! This is the first task in the primary's header cycle. The Proposer processes messages from the
//! `Primary::StateHandler` to track which proposed headers were successfully committed. If a header
//! is not committed before it's round advances, the failed header's block digests are included in a
//! fresh header in FIFO order.
//!
//! Successfully created Headers are sent to the `Primary::Certifier`, where they are reliably
//! broadcast to voting peers. Headers are stored in the `ProposerStore` before they are sent to the
//! Certifier.
//!
//! The Proposer is also responsible for processing Worker block's that reach quorum.
//! Collections of worker blocks that reach quorum are included in each header. If the Proposer's
//! header fails to be committed, then block digests from the failed round are included in the next
//! header once the Proposer's round advances.
